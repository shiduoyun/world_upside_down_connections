It will also approach the study of comparative colonialisms and the underlying assumptions that serve the ability to compare. The author directly states their goal of drawing on Foucault’s insights to think about how the making of race has figured in placing sexuality at the center of imperial politics.","Discourse on Race, Carnality","Edward Said, Michel Foucault","post colonial studies, foucauldian, Marxist theory",Book/Article,1

Federici is particularly interested in the production of new social meaning of woman that accompanied and laid the ground work for capitalism.
